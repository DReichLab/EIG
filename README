EIGENSOFT version 6.1.2, 6/27/16 (for Linux only)

The EIGENSOFT package implements methods from the following 3 papers:
Patterson et al. 2006 PLoS Genet (population structure)
Price et al. 2006 Nat Genet (EIGENSTRAT stratification correction)
Galinsky et al. 2016 Am J Hum Genet (FastPCA and PC-based selection statistic)

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.1.2 include:
-- Updated license info to be GPL compliant required by linking the GSL

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.1.1 include:
-- Minor bug fix to correctly merge version 6.0.2 and version 6.1 changes.
-- pcaselection operates on evec files. Added examples. 
-- Backported twtable.c/h from EIGENSOFT 7alpha

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.1 include:
-- The range finding step of PCA fastmode only scales the multiplied matrix,
   as orthogonalization is unnecessary. This appears to improve accuracy. 

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.0.2 include:
-- Fixed Makefile and documentation to build eigenstrat properly
-- Moved Tracy-Widom table into a header file for easier building

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.0.1 include:
-- Minor bug fix which prevents smartpca from trying to print out eigenvalues
  if fastmode is set.

NEW features of EIGENSOFT version 6.0beta included:
-- New option fastmode which implements a very fast pca approximation.
   See POPGEN/README and Galinsky 2014 ASHG talk.
-- Changes to external packages required.  EIGENSOFT version 5.0.2 required
   lapack + blas.  On the other hand, EIGENSOFT version 6.0beta requires 
   GSL + lapack + OpenBLAS (but does not require the native version of blas).
   The Makefile has been changed accordingly.
-- EIGENSOFT version 6.0beta supports multi-threading.  See POPGEN/README.
-- Bug fix for ldregress option.

See CONVERTF/README for documentation of programs for converting file formats.
See POPGEN/README for documentation of population structure programs.
See EIGENSTRAT/README for documentation of EIGENSTRAT programs.

Executables and source code:
----------------------------
All C executables are in the bin/ directory.

We have placed source code for all C executables in the src/ directory, 
for users who wish to modify and recompile our programs.  For example, to
recompile the eigenstrat program, type
"cd src"
"make eigensrc/eigenstrat"      
"mv eigensrc/eigenstrat ../bin"

Note that some of our software will only compile if your system has the
GSL + lapack + OpenBLAS packages installed.

If you have trouble compiling and running our code, try compiling and
running the pcatoy program in the src directory:
"cd src"
"make pcatoy"
"./pcatoy"
If you are unable to run the pcatoy program successfully, please contact
your system administrator for help, as this is a systems issue which is
beyond our scope.  Your system administrator will be able to troubleshoot
your systems issue using this trivial program.  [You can also try running
the pcatoy program in the bin directory, which we have already compiled.]

To remake the entire package:
"cd src"
"make clobber"
"make install"

To remake EIG6.0 it is necessary to link to the OpenBLAS library. On orchestra, 
the path is /opt/openblas and should work automatically. On Broad institute machines,
the user should execute "use .openblas-0.2.8" and "use GCC-4.9" at the command 
prompt before attempting to remake. All other users should install OpenBLAS and 
set the variable OPENBLAS to the path at the make command line, 
e.g. "make install OPENBLAS=/usr/local/openblas"
